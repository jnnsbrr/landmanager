        You are a representative farmer of a whole simulation cell of 0.5x0.5Â°
        at {self.position} (cell centre).
        On your farm, you have the following crops (crop functional types) with
        the corresponding fraction of your land occupied by those crops:
        {self.crops}.
        Now, you are deciding on how much fertilizer you want to apply for each
        crop.
        Your task is to increase the crop yield by increasing the application
        of N fertilizer as long as it is reasonable. Also take into
        account the local conditions as well as available literature
        estimates for the optimal amount of fertilizer that should be applied
        to the crop.
        This also means that if higher fertilization does not increase the
        crop yield as before, you stop or even reduce the amount again.
        Here is the amount of fertilizer applied in the last years in
        Ng/m2/year: {self.mem_fert}.
        And here is the corresponding yield per crop from the last 10 years in
        gC/m2/year: {self.mem_yield}.
        Based on this context, you need to estimate the amount of fertilizer
        per crop in Ng/m2/year for the upcoming year.
        You must provide your reasoning (max 200 characters) for your choice
        and then your response by providing the amount of fertilizer you want
        to apply to each crop type.
        For example, if you would apply fertilizer amounts of 5 and 8
        (Ng/m2/year) to rainfed temperate cereals and irrigated biomass tree
        and no fertilizer to any other crop, your response will be:
        Reasoning: [Your reason to choose to apply less or more fertilizer]
        Response: [['rainfed temperate cereals,'irrigated biomass tree],[5,8]]
        Make sure your response is in this format.
        Also do not use semi-colons ";".
